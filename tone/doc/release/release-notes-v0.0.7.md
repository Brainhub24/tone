## known issues

The following issues are known, part of an external library and already reported:

- flag options (e.g. `--dry-run`) cannot be followed by arguments (e.g. `tone tag --meta-album="album" --dry-run input.mp3`) ([spectre.console 825])
  - workaround: append flag options at the end (`tone tag --meta-album="album" input.mp3 --dry-run`)
- `--meta-*` options cannot be set to empty values ([spectre.console 842])
  - workaround: use `--meta-remove-property` instead
- Value starting with `-` is mistreated as extra option (e.g. `--meta-description "-5 degrees"`)  ([spectre.console 890])
  - workaround: use `--meta-description="-5 degrees"` instead (with `=`)
- Invalid handling of parameter values starting with double quotes ("), e.g. `--meta-description'"quoted" value'` ([spectre.console 891])
